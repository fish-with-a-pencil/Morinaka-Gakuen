*~*~*~*~*SETTING*~*~*~*~*
 
 Morinaka Gakuen is a state sponsored school for magic and fighting monsters. Despite the fact that it’s government controlled, it’s pretty much the most prestigious of its type, with students clamoring from all over the country to apply and attend. The legendary hunters of last generation, Ijiri Hidekazu, Matsumara Fuyumi, and so on all graduated from from Morinaka. They’re pretty much the gold standard for the education of future hunters. However as a technically public school, they’re beholden to the General Public Advancement law, and are legally obligated to take on “remedial” students, defined as the financially, physically, mentally and/or educationally disadvantaged. If Morinaka is assigned a student by the federal government, they cannot refuse.

To ensure that those who “earn” their right to attending Morinaka are not brought down by mandatory entry students, all students under the remedial designation are put in a separate set of classes and dorms. True Morinaka students don’t even have to ever see a remedial student their entire schooling.

    ***GENERAL WORLD INFORMATION***
    
    Morinaka wasn’t always a publicly funded institution. In fact, the academy gained most of its renown from its two-plus centuries as a private hunting school. Although a few popular names, as far as hunters and mages go, stand out post-buyout, Morinaka clings hard to its exclusive, crème de la crème air. Only during the economic crash thirty years ago did things change; Morinaka went bankrupt with the rest of the country, and the government ended up not bailing them out, but purchasing the school outright. With that came a landslide of changes, which were barely held at bay by the rich alumni of Morinaka. At the end, they compromised on keeping the public students as separate as possible, aside from the rare few who passed the astronomically difficult scholarship exam. True public students of Morinaka GPA (general public advancement) students have their own dorms and school buildings far away from Morinaka’s shinier campus, and they’re often mocked viciously by the private students.
